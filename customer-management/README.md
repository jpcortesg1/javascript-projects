  Customer Management
</h2>

This project is for 3-stage customer management, when a prospect is created, when it is close to paying, and when it is a customer that has already paid. The project allows to create different users which from the start will be stored in the place of potential customers. These clients can move through the entire application, whether it is moved from left to right or right to left or even from end to end.

You move the column clients by dragging the column clients with the mouse, selecting it, and dragging it to where you want to leave it. Clients can be created, edited and deleted from the program. The project was created using the view model, using object-oriented programming, and also created using components.
