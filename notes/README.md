  Notes
</h2>

This project lists notes, as it simulates a note generator, where you can save, list, edit, and delete notes. This project implemented the use of object-oriented programming, the use of local storage, design patterns, and more. To achieve the project, a sketch and a desktop test were first reallocated. In this project, a simple color scheme was handled.

The purpose of this project is to focus on the skills acquired so far.
