  To Do List
</h2>

It is a list of what you do simple, tasks are stored in indexedDB, so this application has a basic crud, so that when the user stores, deletes and/or updates their tasks, These are stored in indexedDB and for this reason they will always be kept as stored. The application has model and view which are handled by the main.js file, also this one is object oriented and created by components.

It has a good design and it is expected that in the next update alerts will be added and have better effects.
